# Phone Number Finder

## Description

This is a simple web service with 1 page and 1 form.  It simply allows the user to paste in any text
into the form field and submit.  The system will then extract all phone numbers in a variety of formats 
and list them out below the form.

## Install and Run
* Clone the repository to a directory
* Optional but recommended: Create a virtual environment
* Run `pip3 install -r requirements`
* Run `python3 phone-finder.py`
* Should display `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`
* Go to that url in the browser
